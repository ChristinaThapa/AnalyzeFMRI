2009-10-19
----------

 Version 1.1-11

- Initialisation of some variables in nifitFMRI.c, slam.unused, sblas.unused and slapack.unused to prevent compiler warnings
- I added function f.read.volume to read a NIFTI or ANALYZE volume file. The function autodetects the format type of the image file
- I modified f.read.analyze.volume and f.read.nifti.volume to always return a 4D array
- I corrected a mistake in the function f.basic.hdr.nifti.list.create where vox.offset and magic fields should reflect the fact that we are in .nii or .img/.hdr NIFTI format
- I also modified the write_nifti_header_wrap_JM C function
- modification of R function f.write.list.to.hdr : I added a function strcomplete to respect the length of some Analyze character fields
- modification of R function f.write.list.to.hdr.nifti : I added a function strcomplete to respect the length of some Nifti character fields
- modification of many fields in help file f.read.nifti.header
- modification of example section from f.write.nifti help file
- There was a bug when using f.write.nifti function to create a .nii file. It is now corrected.
- Functions diminfo2fps and fps2diminfo added
- Functions xyzt2st and st2xyzt added
- I added a directory called niftidoc in the package that contains various documentation files about NIFTI fields
- I added a function f.complete.hdr.nifti.list.create
- I added a function magicfield
- I added a function analyze2nifti
- I added the functions threeDto4D, twoDto4D and fourDto2D
- I added the functions R2Q, Q2R xyz2ijk and ijk2xyz
- I modified f.read.nifti.header to take into account the cases when "" should be "\0" for example
- I added the functions nifti.quatern.to.mat44, mat34.to.TRSZ, mat34.to.TZSR
- I added the functions f.icast.fmri.gui, f.icast.fmri, centering, reduction, eigenvalues, ICAspat, ICAtemp
- I added the function plot.volume
- I modified the file man/EC.3D.Rd to suppress a WARNING on the CRAN

2009-11-03
----------

 Version 1.1-12

- I modified function threeDto4D to (better) check if the headers of all files are the same (depending if we are in NIFTI/Analyze format) 
- I modified function threeDto4D to add a check on datatype and to write the correct number of bytes with readBin/writeBin
- I modified "datatype" entry in f.read.nifti.header.Rd help file
- I modified f.write.nifti function to allow max and min computations when there are NaN values (usefull since SPM uses NaN values as markers for voxels for which it has not calculated any statistics)
- I modified f.write.nii.array.to.img.2bytes, f.write.nii.array.to.img.8bit and f.write.nii.array.to.img.float functions by adding NAOK=TRUE argument to .C calls (usefull since SPM uses NaN values as markers for voxels for which it has not calculated any statistics)
- I modified analyze2nifti function: qform.code and sform.code now take 0 as default values (instead of 2 before). I also added a check to verify if the .mat file exists.
- I added a citation file
- I modified the help file threeDto4D.Rd to warn the user that this function outputs files in the format sent in
- I  modified a few help files before my talk at useR 2010
- I modified the file plot.volume.gui.R to add hscale and vscale factors, thus enabling the possibility to resize the drawing. 
  This is particularly usefull for small laptop screens.
- I modified the file plot.volume.gui.R to correct an error when the visualizer GUI is used with 2D images.
- I modified the function R2Q() to add a qfac parameter. If not provided, we choose it to work with a proper rotation 
  matrix.
- I modified the f.read.header(), f.read.volume() and magicfield() functions to handle the NIFTI-x case (with x in 1...9)
- I modified the file plot.volume.gui.R to add sliders for the anatomical images, and also to take into account the pixdim values
- I modified the f.basic.hdr.list.create() function and its associated documentation to replace mat with X
- I modified the C function read_nifti_header_wrap_JM, the R function f.read.nifit.header() and the associated help file to enable the reading of the extension field, but there is still a problem
- I modified the functions mat34.to.TRSZ() and mat34.to.TZSR() to handle the case of improper rotations.

2011-06-05
----------

 Version 1.1-13

- I modified the file plot.volume.gui.R to correct a bug: the sliders did not move on the anatomical when you clicked on the functional (and vice versa)
- In this same file, I also changed order <- -1 into order <- -1*sign(L$pixdim[2]) (in the function orientation()) and hdr.anat$pixdim[2] into abs(hdr.anat$pixdim[2])

2011-10-19
----------

 Version 1.1-14

- I changed the CITATION file
- I modified line 190 of file spatial.mixture.R to: y <- vector(length = k + 2)
  This was to suppress a warning at the compilation of the package.
- I modified line 950 of file analyzeFMRI.R to: jpeg(filename = paste(file, ".comp.", i, ".jpeg", sep = ""), width = width, height = height)
- removing of compilation warnings in slapack.f

2012-04-05
----------

 Version 1.1-15

- I changed the documentation of file 
- I changed authors order to alphabetical
- I removed file zzz.R
- I added a default NAMESPACE file with useDynLib

  in file plot.volume.gui.R
- I added a warning when flip is not defined when one uses the GUI (in file f.plot.volume.gui.R)
